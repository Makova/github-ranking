\section{Abstract}
  We have been stuying internet communities at a local scale for some
  parts of the last ten years. Our work started with the analysis of social
  networks and community detection (and other measures) among
  bloggers~\cite{blogtalk,PrietoMereloPrietoTricas07,PrietoTricasMereloMoraPrieto08}.
  Recently we have started to measure communities of developres, creating
  GitHub rankings for many Spanish cities.
 In our experience, the creation of these kind of studies tends to induce
 some modifications in the communities themselves: self-awareness induces
 as we have seen in our previous work: creating city (or province) based
 rankings in Spain has led to all kind of interesting effects, including
 increased productivity and community building. 
 The reason for using cities and/or provices was related to the
 availability of an easy to manage way to categorize people and it is
 usually an easier way to `spread the word' 
 We describe the methodology we have used to search for programmers
 residing in a particular province  focusing on those where most population
 is concentrated and apply different measures to show how these communities
 differ in structure, number and productivity. 

On the other side, previous work (mainly in other kinds of human
interaction) suggest that the location has a role even when we are talking
about tecnollogy-mediated communication.  See, for example, `Visualizing
Friendships'\footnote{\url{https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/visualizing-friendships/469716398919}}
where the authors studied interactions inside the Facebook social network,
or~\cite{RattiSobolevskyCalabreseAndrisReadesMartinoClaxtonStrogatz10}
where the subject of analysis are phone calls. We can see that even when
there is technology-mediated communication, the geography seems to be an
important driver.

The location of software developers (mainly in Free/Libre/Open Source,
FLOSS) has also been considered~\cite{BarahonaRoblesAndradasGhosh08,TakhteyevHilts10,EngelhardtFreytagSchulz13}
but we can see that these questions should be the focus of more studies
like this, because the main driver of that previous work seems to be the
metrics about productivity and other similar things.

Our plan is to construct the social network of the developers included in
the top and with these data we will try to discover trends and
configurations: does the centrality of the network correspond to the
geographycal one? Do the developers follow the physical constraints or they
are more open to the relations with not so near developers? They are
supposed to be more fluent with technology and the barriers should be
perceived in a different way.
